option 2: New Code - Create an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application
Your manager has received a request from the engineering department for a prototype of a new application that will provide IP addressing information to network technicians.

Search the internet for REST APIs that retrieve a user's current public IPv4 address and IPv6 address, such as ipapi.co or ipsstack.com. Using the public APIs, create a Python application that displays and formats the computerâ€™s current public IP addressing information.

Depending on the API you select, you may also obtain geolocation information, the provider (ISP), the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the ISP, and country code.
